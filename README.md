# Hangman Game - Python Tkinter

## Project Overview

This is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of chances.

**Key Features:**

*   **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
*   **Timer:** Adds a time limit of 20 seconds per guess, increasing the challenge.
*   **Reset Button:** Allows players to easily start a new game with a different word.
*   **Exit Button:** Provides a convenient way to close the game application.
*   **Keyboard Input:** Supports both button clicks and keyboard input for guessing letters.

## Getting Started

To run the Hangman game on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Game

1.  **Download the script:** Download the `hangman.py` file to your desired location.
2.  **Open your terminal:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `hangman.py`.
3.  **Execute the script:** Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

    This will launch the Hangman game window, and you can start playing immediately.

## Usage

Once the game window is open, you can start guessing letters to find the hidden word.

*   **Guessing Letters:** Click on the letter buttons in the GUI or type letters using your keyboard to make guesses.
*   **Timer:** Be mindful of the timer! You have 20 seconds to make each guess. If the timer runs out, you lose a chance.
*   **Chances:** You start with a limited number of chances, displayed in the game. Incorrect guesses and time-outs will reduce your chances.
*   **Winning:** Guess all the letters in the word before running out of chances to win the game. Congratulations message will be displayed upon winning.
*   **Losing:** If you run out of chances before guessing the word, you lose, and the hidden word will be revealed.
*   **Reset Button:** Click the "Reset" button to start a new game with a different random word.
*   **Exit Button:** Click the "Exit" button to close the Hangman game application.
